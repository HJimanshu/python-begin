print('''Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.''')#using triple code for multiple string literals
print('\n\n\n\n''Twinkle, twinkle, little star,')#using single quotes

print(str1[0])#Extracting individual characters
print(str1[-1])
print(str2[0])#when Extracting first character of the string use [0] indexing and Extracting last character of the string use [-1] if you need some part of the string then We can use slicing
print(str2[-2])
print(str2[2:10])
print(str2[0:15])
